# monitor.aether - System Monitoring NeuroCode Program
# Demonstrates NeuroCode as an independent AI-native programming language

goal: maintain system stability priority: high
agent: on

remember("System monitoring started") as "startup"

# Define monitoring function
define check_system_health()
    remember("Checking system health") as "monitoring"
    optimize for "stability"
    learn from "system.log"
end

# Execute monitoring
run check_system_health()

# Intelligent monitoring logic
when system_issues_detected:
    analyze root_cause
    suggest fix for "system instability"
    apply fix if confidence > 80%
    remember("Auto-fix applied") as "maintenance"
end

# Memory-driven optimization
if memory.pattern("performance_issue", frequency="daily"):
    goal: optimize system performance priority: critical
    optimize for "performance"

# Learn from execution
learn from "monitoring_results"
