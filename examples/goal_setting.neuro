# NeuroCode Goal-Driven Programming Example
# Shows how AI agents work with goals

# Set performance goals
goal: improve system performance > 90% priority: high
goal: reduce memory usage by 25% priority: medium
goal: maintain uptime > 99.9% priority: critical

# Activate the AI agent
agent: on

# The agent will now monitor and work towards goals
check goal "performance"
goal status

# Conditional goal-based actions
if memory.pattern("memory_leak", frequency="daily"):
    goal: fix memory issues priority: urgent
    suggest fix for "memory leaks"
end

# Autonomous goal monitoring
autonomous monitoring

# Agent will suggest actions based on goals
suggest next actions

# Advanced goal patterns
goal: learn from user behavior metrics: engagement=80%,satisfaction=90%
adapt to user_behavior_patterns

# Multi-goal optimization
reflective loop
