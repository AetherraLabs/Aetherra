# Enable AI analysis capabilities
agent: on specialization: "data_analysis"
local_ai: on model: "data_analyst"

# Store data analysis memories
remember("Customer retention improves with personalization") as "insight"
remember("Peak shopping times are 7-9 PM on weekdays") as "behavior_pattern"
remember("Mobile users convert 23% less than desktop") as "conversion_insight"

# Simulate data loading and analysis
analyze "customer_purchase_data.csv" for "spending_patterns"
analyze "user_behavior_logs" for "engagement_metrics"
analyze "product_reviews" for "sentiment_trends"

# Pattern recognition
find_patterns: in "purchase_history"

# AI-powered insights
suggest "customer_segmentation" based_on "purchase_behavior"

    remember(insight) as "validated_finding"
end

# Correlation analysis
correlate: "customer_age" with "product_preferences"
