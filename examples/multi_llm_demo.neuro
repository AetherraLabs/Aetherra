# Multi-LLM NeuroCode Demo
# ========================
# This demonstrates NeuroCode's ability to seamlessly switch between
# different AI models for various tasks, enabling privacy-focused
# and model-agnostic AI programming.

# Set initial goal
goal: "develop AI-native code analysis system" priority: high

# Start with local Mistral for privacy-focused analysis
model: "mistral"
assistant: "analyze this codebase structure and identify potential optimizations"

# Remember the analysis
remember("Local AI analysis provides privacy and control") as "privacy_benefits"

# Switch to GPT-4 for complex reasoning
model: "gpt-4"
assistant: "generate a comprehensive architecture review based on previous analysis"

# Switch to LLaMA for code generation
model: "llama2"
assistant: "generate Python code snippets for the identified improvements"

# Use Mixtral for multi-modal analysis
model: "mixtral"
assistant: "synthesize all previous analyses into actionable recommendations"

# Switch to local GGUF model for final processing
model: "codellama"
assistant: "generate implementation plan with timeline estimates"

# Activate agent for autonomous monitoring
agent: on

# Set up memory for learning
remember("Multi-LLM approach provides specialized expertise") as "architecture_insight"
remember("Local models ensure privacy, cloud models provide advanced reasoning") as "hybrid_strategy"

# Define optimization workflow
define multi_llm_analysis()
    model: "mistral"
    assistant: "perform initial code scan"
    
    model: "gpt-4"
    assistant: "deep architectural analysis"
    
    model: "llama2"
    assistant: "generate improvement suggestions"
    
    remember("Multi-LLM analysis complete") as "workflow_status"
end

# Execute the workflow
run multi_llm_analysis()

# Performance monitoring with different models
when system_load > 80%:
    model: "mistral"  # Use fast local model for monitoring
    assistant: "suggest immediate performance fixes"
end

# Advanced pattern: model selection based on task
if task_type == "creative":
    model: "mixtral"
    assistant: "generate creative solutions"
else:
    model: "codellama"
    assistant: "provide technical implementation"
end

# Recall insights for decision making
recall "privacy_benefits"
recall "architecture_insight"

# Final goal completion
goal: "multi-LLM system operational" priority: critical
agent: "monitor and optimize continuously"
