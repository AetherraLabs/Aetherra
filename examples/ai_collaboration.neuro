# ü§ù AI Collaboration Example
# Demonstrates multi-AI agent collaboration in NeuroCode

# Set up a complex problem requiring multiple AI agents
goal: design a scalable microservices architecture priority: critical
goal: ensure security best practices priority: high  
goal: optimize for performance priority: medium
goal: maintain comprehensive documentation priority: medium

# Activate AI collaboration framework
collaborate: solve "Design an e-commerce microservices system"
agents: [architect, security_expert, performance_specialist, documenter]

# Define the problem scope
problem_scope: |
  Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform that needs to:
  - Handle 10,000+ concurrent users
  - Process payments securely
  - Manage inventory in real-time
  - Provide fast search and recommendations
  - Scale automatically based on demand

# Agent specializations
assign: "overall architecture design" to architect
assign: "security review and hardening" to security_expert  
assign: "performance optimization" to performance_specialist
assign: "technical documentation" to documenter

# Collaborative problem solving workflow
when architect_proposes_solution:
    security_expert: review for "vulnerabilities and compliance"
    performance_specialist: analyze for "scalability bottlenecks"
    documenter: create "architecture documentation"
end

when security_concerns_raised:
    architect: modify design for "enhanced security"
    performance_specialist: validate "security impact on performance"
end

when performance_issues_identified:
    architect: optimize "system design for performance"
    security_expert: ensure "optimizations don't compromise security"
end

# Monitor collaboration progress
monitor: agent_coordination
track: decision_making_process
measure: solution_quality

# Final integration and validation
when all_agents_approve:
    integrate: individual_contributions
    validate: complete_solution
    generate: implementation_roadmap
    remember(final_solution) as "microservices_architecture"
end

# Learn from the collaboration
reflect on "multi-agent collaboration effectiveness"
analyze "how different AI specializations contributed"
suggest "improvements for future collaborations"

# Store lessons learned
remember("AI agents excel when given specialized roles") as "collaboration_insight"
remember("Security and performance need constant coordination") as "architecture_lesson"
