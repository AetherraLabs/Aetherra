# ðŸ§¬ NeuroCode Language Independence Demo
# This program demonstrates NeuroCode as a fully independent AI-native language
# with persistent state, native plugin system, and self-evolving capabilities

goal: demonstrate full language independence priority: critical
agent: on

remember("NeuroCode independence demo started") as "demo"

# === STANDARD LIBRARY PLUGIN DEMONSTRATION ===
# Native NeuroCode plugin invocation - no external dependencies!

# System monitoring using built-in stdlib
plugin: sysmon check_health

# Audio transcription capabilities
plugin: whisper status

# System optimization analysis
plugin: optimizer analyze_system

# Self-repair and debugging
plugin: selfrepair system_check

# === MEMORY AND LEARNING DEMONSTRATION ===
remember("Plugins tested successfully") as "testing"

# Pattern-based learning
if memory.pattern("plugin", frequency="daily"):
    goal: optimize plugin_performance priority: high
    optimize for "plugin_efficiency"
end

# === GOAL-DRIVEN BEHAVIOR ===
goal: maintain system_health > 95% priority: high
goal: ensure plugin_reliability priority: medium

# === INTELLIGENT DECISION MAKING ===
when system_performance < 90%:
    plugin: optimizer suggest_improvements
    apply optimizations if confidence > 80%
    remember("Auto-optimization applied") as "maintenance"
end

# === FUNCTION DEFINITION AND EXECUTION ===
define health_check()
    plugin: sysmon check_health
    plugin: selfrepair system_check
    remember("Health check completed") as "monitoring"
end

# Execute our custom function
run health_check()

# === ADAPTIVE LEARNING ===
learn from "plugin_results"
optimize for "language_independence"

# === AI-NATIVE REFLECTION ===
reflect on "plugin system performance"

# === FUTURE EVOLUTION ===
suggest improvements for "NeuroCode_stdlib"

# === FINAL STATE PERSISTENCE ===
remember("NeuroCode independence demo completed successfully") as "demo"
remember("All plugins functional, state persistent, language autonomous") as "achievement"

# This program demonstrates:
# 1. Native .aether file execution
# 2. Persistent memory and state across sessions
# 3. Built-in standard library plugins
# 4. Goal-driven autonomous behavior
# 5. Self-learning and adaptation
# 6. Function definition and execution
# 7. AI-powered reflection and optimization

# NeuroCode is now truly independent!
