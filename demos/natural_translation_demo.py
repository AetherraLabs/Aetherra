🎉 Natural-to-AetherraCode Translation Revolution Demo
=================================================

This demonstrates the breakthrough feature that makes AetherraCode truly accessible:
Natural Language Programming through AI-powered translation.

No more learning syntax - just speak your intent and watch it become executable code!
