🧬 SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING LOOP DEMONSTRATION
=============================================

Demonstrates the enhanced Self-Directed Learning Loop capabilities:

🎯 create_learning_goal(memory_issue): Transform gaps/conflicts into learning goals
📊 track_outcomes(): Evaluate learning success via memory updates
🎛️ adjust_thresholds(): Tune sensitivity based on resolution success

Key Features:
• Autonomous goal creation from memory issues
• Comprehensive outcome tracking with success metrics
• Adaptive threshold adjustment based on performance
• Full audit trail with learning insights
