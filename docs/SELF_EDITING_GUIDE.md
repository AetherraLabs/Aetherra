# Neuroplex Self-Editing Capabilities

Neuroplex now has the ability to read, analyze, correct, and evolve its own codebase through NeuroCode commands. This creates a closed learning loop where the system becomes a living program that rewrites and improves itself.

## Core Self-Editing Commands

### 1. File Loading and Analysis
```neurocode
load "filename.py"                    # Load a file for analysis
analyze "filename.py"                 # Deep analysis of loaded code
```

### 2. AI-Powered Refactoring
```neurocode
refactor "filename.py" "target"       # Suggest improvements for specific target
refactor "core/memory.py" "performance optimization"
refactor "ui/neuro_ui.py" "better error handling"
```

### 3. Review and Apply Changes
```neurocode
diff fix_id                          # Review proposed changes
apply fix fix_id                     # Apply changes after review
backup "filename.py"                 # Create backup before changes
```

### 4. Safety Controls
```neurocode
set self_edit_mode on                # Enable self-editing (required for apply)
set self_edit_mode off               # Disable for safety
```

## Memory-Driven Justification

The system uses its memory to justify self-editing decisions:

```neurocode
# Pattern-based suggestions
if memory.pattern("recurring plugin error"):
    assistant: improve plugin loading logic
    apply fix to "core/plugin_manager.py"

# Memory-driven analysis
self edit opportunities               # Analyze memory for self-editing opportunities
```

## Advanced Self-Editing Workflow

1. **Learn from patterns**: The system remembers code issues and patterns
2. **Proactive analysis**: Suggests files that need attention based on memory
3. **Memory-driven justification**: Explains why changes are needed
4. **Safe application**: Requires explicit approval and creates backups

## Example Workflow

```neurocode
# Step 1: Load and analyze code
load "demo_code.py"
analyze "demo_code.py"

# Step 2: Suggest improvements
refactor "demo_code.py" "code quality improvements"

# Step 3: Review changes
diff demo_code.py_20250628_143022

# Step 4: Apply if satisfied
set self_edit_mode on
apply fix demo_code.py_20250628_143022

# Step 5: Remember the improvement
remember("Improved demo_code.py with better iteration patterns", tags="refactor,improvement")
```

## Safety Features

- **Backup Creation**: Automatic timestamped backups before any changes
- **Review Process**: All changes must be reviewed via `diff` command
- **Self-Edit Mode**: Explicit safety flag that must be enabled
- **Memory Justification**: AI explains why changes are beneficial
- **Approval Step**: No automatic application of changes

## Future Enhancements

- Version snapshot management
- Agent mode for autonomous self-editing
- Diff viewer in UI
- Approval workflows with multiple options
- Integration with version control systems

This self-editing capability transforms Neuroplex from a static system into a living, evolving codebase that learns and improves itself based on usage patterns and accumulated knowledge.
