# ðŸš€ NeuroCode Tutorial: Your First AI-Native Program

Welcome to NeuroCode, a pioneering AI-consciousness programming language! This tutorial will guide you through creating your first NeuroCode program step by step.

## What Makes NeuroCode Special?

Unlike traditional programming languages that execute static instructions, NeuroCode programs:

- ðŸ§  **Think and reason** about problems
- ðŸ’¾ **Remember and learn** from experiences  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Understand intentions** rather than just commands
- ðŸ¤– **Collaborate with AI** agents in real-time
- âš¡ **Self-optimize** for better performance

## Tutorial 1: Your First NeuroCode Program

### Step 1: Store Your First Memory

```neurocode
# NeuroCode treats memory as a first-class citizen
remember("I'm learning NeuroCode - the future of programming!") as "first_step"
```

### Step 2: Set a Learning Goal

```neurocode
# Express your intentions, not just steps
goal: master NeuroCode fundamentals priority: high
```

### Step 3: Activate Your AI Agent

```neurocode
# Enable AI collaboration
agent: on learning: continuous
```

### Step 4: Let NeuroCode Think

```neurocode
# NeuroCode analyzes and provides insights
analyze "my learning progress"
suggest "next steps for mastery"
```

### Complete First Program

```neurocode
# ðŸ§¬ My First NeuroCode Program
remember("I'm learning NeuroCode - the future of programming!") as "first_step"
goal: master NeuroCode fundamentals priority: high
agent: on learning: continuous

analyze "my learning progress"
suggest "next steps for mastery"
```

## Tutorial 2: Working with Memory

### Basic Memory Operations

```neurocode
# Store different types of memories
remember("Python is great for data science") as "programming_fact"
remember("I love building web applications") as "personal_interest"
remember("Security is crucial in development") as "best_practice"

# Retrieve memories
recall "programming_fact"
recall memories with "development"
```

### Tagged Memories

```neurocode
# Add tags for better organization
remember("React makes UI development faster") as "web_insight" tags: ["react", "frontend", "productivity"]
remember("PostgreSQL is reliable for large datasets") as "database_insight" tags: ["postgresql", "database", "scalability"]

# Search by tags
recall all tagged: "frontend"
recall memories with tags: ["database", "scalability"]
```

## Tutorial 3: Goal-Driven Programming

### Setting Goals

```neurocode
# Simple goals
goal: learn machine learning

# Prioritized goals
goal: build a chatbot priority: high
goal: optimize database performance priority: medium
goal: write comprehensive tests priority: low

# Conditional goals
goal: deploy to production when tests_pass and security_approved
```

### Goal Tracking

```neurocode
# NeuroCode automatically tracks your progress
goal: complete NeuroCode tutorial priority: high
agent: on

# The AI will suggest steps and track completion
analyze "tutorial completion progress"
suggest "areas that need more focus"
```

## Tutorial 4: AI Collaboration

### Single Agent Assistance

```neurocode
# Activate an AI agent with specific focus
agent: on specialization: "web_development"

# Ask for analysis and suggestions
analyze "best practices for REST API design"
suggest "security measures for user authentication"
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

```neurocode
# Complex problems benefit from multiple AI agents
collaborate: solve "design scalable microservices architecture"
agents: [architect, security_expert, performance_specialist]

# Agents work together automatically
assign: "overall design" to architect
assign: "security review" to security_expert
assign: "performance optimization" to performance_specialist
```

## Tutorial 5: Multi-LLM Integration

### Switching Between AI Models

NeuroCode supports multiple AI models that you can switch between seamlessly:

```neurocode
# Use OpenAI for complex reasoning
model: "gpt-4"
assistant: "design a scalable architecture for a social media platform"

# Switch to local Mistral for privacy-sensitive tasks
model: "mistral"
assistant: "analyze this user data while keeping it private"

# Use LLaMA for code generation
model: "llama2"
assistant: "generate the authentication middleware code"

# Use Mixtral for final review
model: "mixtral"
assistant: "review the complete implementation for security issues"
```

### Privacy-First Development

```neurocode
# Keep sensitive data on local models
model: "mistral"  # Local model for privacy
assistant: "analyze customer behavior patterns from encrypted data"

# Use cloud models for general tasks
model: "gpt-4"    # Cloud model for advanced reasoning
assistant: "suggest UI improvements based on general UX principles"
```

### Model-Specific Workflows

```neurocode
# Different models for different strengths
define analyze_codebase()
    model: "gpt-4"
    assistant: "identify architectural patterns and potential issues"
    
    model: "codellama"
    assistant: "suggest code optimizations and refactoring opportunities"
    
    model: "claude-3"
    assistant: "review for security vulnerabilities and best practices"
    
    # Combine insights
    remember("codebase analysis completed with multi-model approach") as "analysis"
end
```

## Tutorial 6: Advanced Features

### User-Defined Functions with AI

```neurocode
# Define functions that leverage AI assistance
define optimize_performance(component)
    model: "gpt-4"
    assistant: "analyze performance bottlenecks in " + component
    
    if assistant_confidence > 80%:
        apply suggested_optimizations
        remember("optimized " + component) as "performance_improvements"
    else:
        model: "claude-3"
        assistant: "provide alternative optimization strategies for " + component
    end
end

# Use the function
optimize_performance("database_queries")
optimize_performance("frontend_rendering")
```

### Conditional AI Model Selection

```neurocode
# Choose model based on requirements
if privacy_required:
    model: "mistral"    # Local model
else:
    model: "gpt-4"      # Best performance
end

assistant: "process user request based on privacy requirements"

# Performance-based selection
if task_complexity > 7:
    model: "gpt-4"      # Complex reasoning
else:
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Faster, simpler tasks
end
```

### Learning from Multi-Model Insights

```neurocode
# Gather insights from multiple models
define get_multi_model_insights(problem)
    insights = []
    
    model: "gpt-4"
    gpt4_insight = assistant: "analyze " + problem + " from technical perspective"
    insights.append(gpt4_insight)
    
    model: "claude-3"
    claude_insight = assistant: "analyze " + problem + " from user experience perspective"
    insights.append(claude_insight)
    
    model: "mistral"
    mistral_insight = assistant: "analyze " + problem + " from security perspective"
    insights.append(mistral_insight)
    
    # Synthesize insights
    model: "gpt-4"
    synthesis = assistant: "combine these insights into actionable recommendations: " + str(insights)
    
    remember(synthesis) as "multi_model_analysis"
    return synthesis
end
```

### Performance Optimization

```neurocode
# Automatic performance optimization
optimize: current_code
profile: execution_time, memory_usage
