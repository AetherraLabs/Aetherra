## Introduction

NeuroCode is the world's first **AI-native programming language** where code thinks, learns, and evolves alongside you. Unlike traditional programming languages that execute static instructions, NeuroCode programs are living entities that can:

- üß† **Think and reason** about problems autonomously
- üéØ **Understand intentions** rather than just execute commands
- üíæ **Remember and learn** from past experiences
- ü§ñ **Collaborate with AI** agents in real-time
- ‚ö° **Self-optimize** for better performance

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neurocode-foundation/neurocode.git
cd neurocode

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Neuroplex GUI
python launch_neuroplex.py

# Or run NeuroCode directly
python main.py
```

### Your First NeuroCode Program

```neurocode
# Welcome to NeuroCode!
remember("I'm learning the future of programming!") as "first_experience"
goal: understand NeuroCode fundamentals priority: high
agent: on

# NeuroCode thinks about your goals
analyze "my learning progress"
suggest "next steps for mastery"

# Execute and watch the magic happen!
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Memory-First Programming

NeuroCode treats memory as a first-class citizen:

```neurocode
# Store experiences and knowledge
remember("Python is great for data science") as "language_insight"
remember("Always validate user input") as "security_principle"

# Recall related memories
recall insights about "programming languages"
memory: show connections between "security" and "validation"
```

### 2. Goal-Oriented Execution

Programs express intentions, not just steps:

```neurocode
# Set high-level goals
goal: build a secure web application priority: critical
goal: optimize for performance priority: medium
goal: ensure accessibility priority: high

# NeuroCode automatically plans and executes
agent: on
analyze "current codebase" for "security vulnerabilities"
suggest "performance optimizations"
```

### 3. AI Collaboration

Work with AI agents as programming partners:

```neurocode
# Activate AI collaboration
collaborate: solve "optimize database queries"
agents: [code_generator, optimizer, debugger, documenter]

# AI agents work together
when problem_complex:
    delegate_to: specialized_agent
    coordinate: multi_agent_solution
end
```

## Language Syntax

### Basic Constructs

#### Memory Operations
```neurocode
# Store memory
remember("content") as "tag"
remember("Advanced AI techniques") as "learning"

# Retrieve memory
recall "tag"
recall memories with "keyword"
recall similar_to "concept"

# Memory analytics
memory: summary
memory: connections between "concept1" and "concept2"
memory: optimize storage
```

#### Goal Setting
```neurocode
# Simple goals
goal: learn machine learning

# Prioritized goals
goal: build chatbot priority: high
goal: optimize performance priority: medium
goal: write documentation priority: low

# Conditional goals
goal: deploy_to_production when tests_pass and security_validated
```

#### Agent Control
```neurocode
# Activate AI agent
agent: on
agent: off

# Agent with specific focus
agent: on learning: continuous
agent: on mode: collaborative
agent: on specialization: "data_analysis"
```

#### Analysis and Suggestions
```neurocode
# Analyze anything
analyze "code quality"
analyze "user behavior patterns"
analyze "system performance"

# Get AI suggestions
suggest "improvements"
suggest "optimizations" for "database_queries"
suggest "next_steps" based_on "current_progress"
```

### Control Flow

#### Conditionals
```neurocode
if condition:
    # NeuroCode actions
    remember("condition was true") as "observation"
end

when event_occurs:
    # Event-driven programming
    agent: activate specialized_response
end

unless problem_solved:
    continue: problem_solving_process
end
```

#### Loops
```neurocode
for item in collection:
    analyze item
    if interesting:
        remember(item) as "interesting_data"
    end
end

while learning:
    acquire: new_knowledge
    integrate: with existing_knowledge
    reflect: on learning_progress
end
```

#### Pattern Matching
```neurocode
match input_type:
    case "data_analysis":
        activate: data_analysis_agent
    case "web_development":
        activate: web_development_agent
    case "machine_learning":
        activate: ml_specialist_agent
    default:
        analyze: determine_best_approach
end
```

## AI Enhancement Features

### 1. Local AI Processing

```neurocode
# Activate local AI
local_ai: on
model: "mistral-7b"
inference: real_time

# Use local AI for processing
local_process: "analyze this code for bugs"
local_generate: "write a function to sort data"
```

### 2. Vector Memory

```neurocode
# Semantic memory storage
remember("Neural networks excel at pattern recognition") as "ai_insight"
remember("Transformers revolutionized NLP") as "ai_breakthrough"

# Semantic search
search_similar: "deep learning advantages"
find_connections: between "neural networks" and "pattern recognition"
```

### 3. Intent-to-Code Generation

```neurocode
# Natural language programming
intent: "Create a REST API for user management"
constraints: [secure, scalable, well_documented]
generate: auto

# Refine with feedback
intent: "Add rate limiting to the API"
modify: existing_code
validate: security_requirements
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

```neurocode
# Automatic optimization
optimize: current_code
profile: execution_time, memory_usage
suggest: improvements

# Continuous optimization
auto_optimize: on
monitor: performance_metrics
adapt: based_on_usage_patterns
```

### 5. Multi-AI Collaboration

```neurocode
# Complex problem solving
collaborate: solve "design microservices architecture"
agents: [architect, security_expert, performance_specialist, documenter]

# Specialized roles
assign: code_generation to "coding_specialist"
assign: security_review to "security_expert"
assign: optimization to "performance_specialist"
```
