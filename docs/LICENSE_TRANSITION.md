# NeuroCode License Transition: MIT ‚Üí GPL-3.0

## Strategic License Change

**Date**: June 29, 2025  
**Change**: MIT License ‚Üí GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)  
**Rationale**: Aligning with our vision as "The Linux of AI-Native Systems"

## Why We Made This Change

### üéØ **Following the Linux Model**
Just as Linux kernel uses GPL-2.0 (GPL-3.0 is the modern version), NeuroCode adopts GPL-3.0 to:
- Ensure all AI OS improvements benefit the entire community
- Prevent fragmentation of the AI OS ecosystem
- Create strong incentives for collaborative development
- Protect against proprietary forks by big tech companies

### üõ°Ô∏è **Strategic Protection**
- **Prevents Exploitation**: Microsoft, Google, Amazon cannot create proprietary AI OS forks
- **Ensures Unity**: All derivatives must remain open source and contribute back
- **Community First**: Prioritizes ecosystem health over corporate convenience
- **Democratic AI**: Keeps AI operating systems accessible to everyone

### üåç **Vision Alignment**
Our README states: *"Just as Linux democratized server computing, NeuroCode AI OS will democratize intelligent computing."*

Using GPL-3.0 ensures we follow the exact licensing strategy that made Linux the most successful open-source project in history.

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ **For Contributors**
- Your contributions are protected under strong copyleft
- All improvements to the AI OS remain community assets
- No risk of your work being used in proprietary systems

### ‚úÖ **For Users**
- NeuroCode remains completely free and open source
- No changes to usage, modification, or distribution rights
- Stronger guarantee that the AI OS stays community-driven

### ‚úÖ **For the Ecosystem**
- Prevents fragmentation of AI OS standards
- Encourages unified development efforts
- Creates the foundation for a true community-driven AI operating system

## License Compatibility

### Compatible Licenses
- GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0
- Most major open-source projects can integrate with NeuroCode

### Incompatible Licenses
- MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD (for derivative works)
- Proprietary/closed-source systems cannot incorporate NeuroCode

## Implementation

- **Effective Date**: June 29, 2025
- **Repository**: Updated LICENSE file with full GPL-3.0 text
- **Documentation**: Updated README and project materials
- **Community**: Open discussion on licensing strategy

## The Future

This license change positions NeuroCode to become the foundation of the first truly open-source AI operating system. By following the proven Linux model, we ensure that:

1. **Innovation flourishes** within an open ecosystem
2. **Community benefits** from all improvements
3. **Big tech cannot** create proprietary AI OS forks
4. **Democracy in AI** remains achievable

## Questions?

This change aligns with our core mission: creating the world's first community-driven AI operating system. The GPL-3.0 license is the legal foundation that makes this vision possible.
