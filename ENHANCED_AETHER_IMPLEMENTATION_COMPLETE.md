## Key Improvements

### 🎨 Syntax Modernization
- Changed from `: ... end` to `{ ... }` block syntax
- Updated function definitions from `define` to `fn`
- Added explicit `return` statements

### 🛡️ Enhanced Safety
- Comprehensive error handling with `try/catch`
- Safe loop controls with `break/continue`
- Exception-based flow control

### ⚡ Better Performance
- Optimized execution engine
- Efficient control structures
- Smart timing controls with `wait`

### 🔗 Improved Integration
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Clean module system with `import/use`
- Unified language interface

## Real-World Impact

### Enhanced Goal Autopilot
The flagship `goal_autopilot.aether` script can now use:
- **Smart error handling** with try/catch for plugin failures
- **Pattern matching** for goal status processing
- **Timing controls** for retry delays
- **Enhanced loops** with break/continue for efficiency

### Example Usage
```aether
# Modern .aether with enhanced features
plugin enhanced_goal_processor {
    fn process_goals() {
        let goals = get_incomplete_goals()

        for goal in goals {
            if goal.locked {
                continue  # Skip locked goals
            }

            try {
                match goal.status {
                    case "pending": {
                        if should_retry(goal) {
                            call resume_goal(goal)
                        }
                    }
                    case "stalled": {
                        call escalate_goal(goal)
                    }
                    default: {
                        log f"Unknown status: {goal.status}"
                    }
                }
            } catch (error) {
                log f"Error: {error}"
                wait 30s  # Delay before next goal
            }
        }

        return "Processing complete"
    }
}
```

## Migration Path

### For Existing Scripts
1. **Gradual Migration**: Old syntax still works
2. **Enhancement Opportunities**: Add error handling, return values
3. **Performance Gains**: Use new control structures for better flow

### For New Scripts
1. **Use Modern Syntax**: `{}` blocks, `fn` functions
2. **Leverage New Features**: try/catch, match/case, wait
3. **Follow Best Practices**: Explicit returns, proper error handling

## Validation Results

✅ **Grammar Implementation**: All enhanced features present in grammar
✅ **Interpreter Engine**: All execution methods implemented
✅ **Integration Layer**: Unified interface with backward compatibility
✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite validates all features
✅ **Documentation**: Complete guide with examples and migration info

## Next Steps
