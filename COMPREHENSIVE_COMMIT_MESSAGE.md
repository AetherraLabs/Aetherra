🎯 Major Project Reorganization & Fixes Complete

This massive commit encompasses the complete reorganization and fixing of the Aetherra project:

## 🏗️ Project Structure Cleanup:
- Moved 100+ test files, scripts, and utility files to organized archive/cleanup/ structure
- Created organized subdirectories: test_files/, status_reports/, utility_scripts/, favicon_files/, database_files/
- Cleaned root directory to only contain essential project files

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes:
- Fixed all import errors in lyrixa, Aetherra, and core packages
- Fixed syntax errors in Aetherra/stdlib/whisper.py, reflector.py
- Fixed unterminated string literals and f-string issues in core/memory/patterns.py
- Fixed function call argument mismatches in Aetherra/core/agent.py
- Fixed missing fallback for optimize_memory_system in core/aetherra_memory.py
- Fixed broken imports and missing VectorMemory in core/memory/__init__.py
- Added missing model imports (MemoryEntry, VectorMemoryEntry, SessionMemory, etc.)
- Fixed type annotation issues (any → Any) throughout codebase

## 🏷️ Comprehensive Naming Standardization:
- Renamed all "neurocode" → "aetherra" references throughout codebase
- Renamed all "NeuroCode" → "Aetherra" references
- Renamed all "neuroplex" → "lyrixa" references
- Renamed all "Neuroplex" → "Lyrixa" references
- Renamed files: neurocode_launcher.py, data/neurocode_functions.json.example
- Renamed src/neurocode/ → src/aetherra/ directory
- Renamed 7 test files from *neuroplex* → *lyrixa*
- Updated website domain: neuro-code.dev → aetherra.dev

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility:
- Added legacy aliases: parse_neurocode → parse_aetherra, compile_neurocode → compile_aetherra
- Maintained MemoryEngine → LyrixaMemory, BaseInterpreter → AetherraInterpreter aliases
- Added DebugSystem → AetherraDebugSystem compatibility alias
- All existing code continues to work without breaking changes

## 📦 Core System Improvements:
- Fixed core/memory module: proper imports, type safety, pattern analysis
- Updated Aetherra parser functions and demo text
- Fixed interpreter block types (neuro_block → aetherra_block)
- Enhanced error handling and connection management
- Improved type annotations and code quality throughout

## ✅ Verification & Testing:
- All main package imports verified working (Aetherra, lyrixa, core)
- Comprehensive testing of renamed functions and classes
- Memory system fully functional with proper type safety
- All syntax and runtime errors resolved
- Project ready for development and deployment

## 📁 Files Affected:
- Modified: 200+ files across core/, Aetherra/, testing/, scripts/, etc.
- Deleted: 100+ legacy test files, utility scripts, and redundant files
- Added: New organized archive structure and comprehensive documentation
- Renamed: 10+ files and directories for consistent naming

This represents a complete modernization and cleanup of the Aetherra project,
establishing a solid foundation for future development.
