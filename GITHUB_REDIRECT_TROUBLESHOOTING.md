## üîß **SOLUTIONS TO TRY**

### **1. Clear Browser Cache (Recommended)**
```bash
# Chrome/Edge:
Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Cached images and files

# Firefox:
Ctrl + Shift + Delete ‚Üí Clear cached web content

# Or use Private/Incognito mode to test
```

### **2. Hard Refresh the Website**
```bash
# Windows:
Ctrl + F5  or  Ctrl + Shift + R

# Mac:
Cmd + Shift + R
```

### **3. Clear DNS Cache (Windows)**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator:
ipconfig /flushdns
```

### **4. Test with Direct URL**
Open a new browser tab and go directly to:
```
https://github.com/Zyonic88/NeuroCode
```

### **5. Check if GitHub has URL Redirects**
The old repository might have a redirect set up. Try:
- Go to: https://github.com/VirtualVerse-Corporation/NeuroCode
- See if it automatically redirects to the new repository

## üîç **DIAGNOSIS**

The issue is most likely one of these:

1. **Browser Cache**: Your browser cached the old HTML files with old links
2. **GitHub Repository Redirect**: The old repository might have a redirect that's interfering
3. **DNS Cache**: Your system is resolving cached DNS entries

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTION**

**Try this right now:**
1. Open an **incognito/private window** in your browser
2. Navigate to your website 
3. Click the GitHub links
4. They should go to the correct repository: `Zyonic88/NeuroCode`

If the links work correctly in incognito mode, the issue is definitely browser cache.
