## **Technical Implementation**

### **File Structure**
```
optimized_memory_retrieval.py          # Core optimization system
Aetherra/lyrixa/memory/
  └── optimized_integration.py         # Integration with LyrixaMemoryEngine
production_storage_optimizations.py    # Storage layer optimizations
```

### **Integration Strategy**
- **Non-breaking**: Drop-in enhancement for existing memory engine
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if optimizations unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive performance metrics and reporting

### **Memory Overhead**
- **Cache**: ~2MB for 50 cached queries
- **Indexes**: ~5MB for pre-computed patterns
- **Threads**: 2 background worker threads
- **Total**: <10MB additional memory usage

   memory_engine = OptimizedEngine()
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   ```python
   # Get optimization report
   report = memory_engine.get_optimization_report()
   print(f"Performance: {report['performance_improvement']['improvement_factor']}")
   ```

3. **Enhanced Recall**:
   ```python
   # Use optimized recall with statistics
   result = await memory_engine.recall_with_stats("query")
   performance = result['performance']
   ```
