### Architecture:
```
Goal Input → Vector Embedding → Similarity Analysis → Plugin Matching → Multi-Agent Orchestration → Persistent Storage → Historical Learning
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Forecasting:
```python
from lyrixa.goal_forecaster import forecast_goal

result = forecast_goal("Optimize database performance and indexing")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.1%}")
print(f"Risk: {result['risk']}")
```

### Async Multi-Agent Execution:
```python
from lyrixa.goal_forecaster import forecast_goal_async

result = await forecast_goal_async("Install analytics plugin")
orchestration = result.get('orchestration', {})
print(f"Agents executed: {len(orchestration.get('steps', []))}")
```

### Hot Plugin Reload:
```python
from lyrixa.goal_forecaster import reload_plugins

results = reload_plugins()
for result in results:
    print(f"Plugin {result['plugin']}: {'✅' if result['success'] else '❌'}")
```

### System Statistics:
```python
from lyrixa.goal_forecaster import get_system_stats

stats = get_system_stats()
print(f"Total forecasts: {stats['total_forecasts']}")
print(f"Average confidence: {stats['average_confidence']:.1%}")
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Models**: Custom trained models for goal-specific predictions
- **Real-time Feedback**: Learning from actual execution outcomes
- **Distributed Agents**: Cross-system agent coordination
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Complex workflow dependencies and rollback capabilities

## 🎯 Impact
