  - `escalate_goal(goal)` - Routes stalled goals to supervisor agents
  - `get_agents_by_role(role)` - Finds available agents
  - `get_agent_status(agent_id)` - Checks agent health and load

#### 4. `Aetherra/system/logger.aether` - 📝 EVENT LOGGING
- **Purpose**: Structured event logging for system monitoring
- **Functions**:
  - `log_event(type, data, level)` - Logs structured events
  - `get_logs_by_type(type, limit, hours)` - Retrieves filtered logs
  - Auto-cleanup of old log entries

#### 5. `Aetherra/system/utils.aether` - 🛠️ UTILITIES
- **Purpose**: Shared utility functions for time and data operations
- **Functions**:
  - `time_since(timestamp)` - Calculates time differences
  - `format_duration(seconds)` - Human-readable time formatting
  - `execution_time()` - Tracks script execution timing

#### 6. `Aetherra/system/plugins.aether` - 🔌 PLUGIN HEALTH
- **Purpose**: Plugin health monitoring and diagnostics
- **Functions**:
  - `check_plugin_health(plugin_name)` - Verifies plugin availability
  - Health status tracking and failure detection

### Integration Architecture

```

├── calls system/goals.get_incomplete_goals()
├── calls system/utils.time_since()
├── calls system/plugins.check_plugin_health()
├── calls system/goals.resume_goal()
├── calls system/goals.mark_goal_failed()

└── calls system/logger.log_event()
```

### Key Features

#### 🔄 Automatic Goal Processing
- Scans all incomplete goals every 30 minutes
- Respects configurable retry delays (default: 10 minutes)
- Maximum retry attempts limit (default: 3)
- Plugin health verification before retry attempts

#### ⚡ Smart Escalation
- Escalates goals stalled beyond threshold (default: 1 hour)
- Routes to supervisor agents when available
- Creates escalation tickets when no agents available
- Comprehensive escalation event logging

#### 📊 Monitoring & Analytics
- Detailed logging of all autopilot actions
- Goal statistics and metrics
- Execution time tracking
- Run history and trends

#### 🛡️ Safety & Reliability
- Goal locking to prevent concurrent processing
- Error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive exception logging
- Configurable safety thresholds

### Configuration Options

```aether
config: {
    retry_delay_minutes: 10,        # Time between retry attempts
    escalation_threshold_hours: 1,  # When to escalate stalled goals
    max_retry_attempts: 3,          # Maximum retries before failure
    plugin_health_check: true,      # Verify plugins before retry
    log_all_actions: true          # Comprehensive logging
}
```

### Testing & Validation

#### Test Script: `Aetherra/system/test_goal_autopilot.aether`
- Comprehensive integration testing
- System dependency verification
- Manual autopilot execution testing
- Statistics and metrics validation

### Usage Examples

#### Manual Trigger
```aether
# Trigger autopilot manually for testing
call system/goal_autopilot.trigger_manual_run()
```

#### Get Statistics
```aether
# View autopilot performance metrics
call system/goal_autopilot.get_statistics()
```

#### Create Test Goal
```aether
# Create a goal for autopilot to manage
call system/goals.create_goal(
    "Example Task",
    "A sample goal for testing",
    "example_plugin",
    "normal"
)
```

## Benefits

### 🚀 Autonomous Operation
- Self-managing goal system that works without human intervention
- Intelligent retry logic prevents temporary failures from stopping progress
- Automatic escalation ensures no goals are permanently stuck

### 📈 Improved Reliability
- Plugin health checking prevents retry attempts on broken plugins
- Comprehensive error tracking and recovery mechanisms
- Configurable limits prevent infinite retry loops

### 👀 Full Observability
- Complete audit trail of all autopilot actions
- Rich metrics and statistics for system monitoring
- Structured logging enables easy debugging and analysis

### 🔧 Flexibility
- Highly configurable parameters for different environments
- Manual trigger capability for testing and debugging
- Modular design allows easy extension and customization

## Next Steps

1. **System Integration**: Deploy the autopilot as a scheduled system service
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up dashboards to track autopilot effectiveness
3. **Alert Configuration**: Configure notifications for escalated goals
4. **Advanced Policies**: Implement priority-based processing and resource allocation

## File Locations

All files are correctly placed in the `Aetherra/system/` directory following the established Aetherra OS structure:

- `Aetherra/system/goal_autopilot.aether` (Flagship script)
- `Aetherra/system/goals.aether`
- `Aetherra/system/agents.aether`
- `Aetherra/system/logger.aether`
- `Aetherra/system/utils.aether`
- `Aetherra/system/plugins.aether`
- `Aetherra/system/test_goal_autopilot.aether`

## Conclusion

The Goal Autopilot system is now fully implemented and ready for production use. It provides a robust, intelligent, and observable system for autonomous goal management that will keep the Aetherra OS moving toward its intended objectives even when individual goals encounter temporary setbacks.

The implementation follows Aetherra OS best practices with proper error handling, comprehensive logging, and modular design that makes it easy to maintain and extend in the future.
