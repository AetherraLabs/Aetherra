# Contributing to NeuroCode

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NeuroCode, the world's first AI-native programming language! 🧬

## 🌟 How to Contribute

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs
- Include NeuroCode version, OS, and steps to reproduce
- Provide sample NeuroCode code that demonstrates the issue

### 💡 Suggesting Features
- Open a GitHub Issue with the "enhancement" label
- Describe the cognitive programming pattern you'd like to see
- Explain how it would improve AI-native development

### 🔧 Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neurocode.git
cd neurocode
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running Tests
```bash
python test_core_features.py
python test_gui_import.py
python comprehensive_analysis.py
```

#### Development Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (enforced by Ruff)
- Add comprehensive docstrings to new functions
- Include test cases for new features
- Update documentation when adding new NeuroCode syntax

### 🧠 Areas We Need Help With
- **Language Features**: New NeuroCode syntax patterns
- **AI Integration**: Better natural language processing
- **Performance**: Optimization of the interpreter engine
- **Documentation**: Examples, tutorials, and guides
- **Testing**: Edge cases and integration tests
- **Plugins**: New plugins for the ecosystem

### 📋 Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### 💭 Philosophy
Remember that NeuroCode is about **cognitive programming** - expressing intentions rather than implementations. When contributing, think about:
- How does this make programming more intuitive?
- Does this help developers express **what** they want rather than **how** to do it?
- Can AI understand and act on this pattern?

## 🏷️ Labels
