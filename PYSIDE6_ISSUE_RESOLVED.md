# 🎯 PYSIDE6 ISSUE RESOLUTION COMPLETE!

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED: PySide6 Import Errors Fixed**

The issue wasn't that PySide6 wasn't available - it was installed correctly. The problem was **incorrect import locations** and **misplaced UI code** in the Lyrixa GUI files.

### 🔧 **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED & FIXED:**

#### **1. QAction Import Error** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: `QAction` was imported from `QtWidgets` but in PySide6 it's in `QtGui`
- **Solution**: Moved `QAction` import to the correct `QtGui` module
- **Fix Applied**: Updated import in `_setup_qt_window()` method

#### **2. Missing Plugins Attribute** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: `self.plugins` was accessed before being initialized
- **Solution**: Moved core functionality initialization before Qt setup
- **Fix Applied**: Reordered initialization in `__init__()` method

#### **3. Misplaced UI Code** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: UI setup code was incorrectly placed in `load_plugins_list()` method
- **Solution**: Removed UI setup code from plugins method, kept only plugin loading logic
- **Fix Applied**: Cleaned up `load_plugins_list()` to only handle plugin display

#### **4. Scope Issues** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: Variables like `main_splitter` were used outside their defined scope
- **Solution**: Removed orphaned UI code that was causing scope errors
- **Fix Applied**: Cleaned up method boundaries and variable scoping

### 🚀 **CURRENT STATUS:**
