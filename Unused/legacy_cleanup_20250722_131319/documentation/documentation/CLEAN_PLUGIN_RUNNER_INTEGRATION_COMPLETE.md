Plugin Execution Flow:
1. User selects plugin from dropdown
2. Parameters entered in JSON format
3. Goal context added if needed
4. Plugin executed through plugin manager
5. Results displayed in output panel
6. Error handling and debugging information provided

VERIFICATION:
============

Integration tests confirm:
- ✅ All required methods exist in LyrixaWindow
- ✅ Plugin discovery system functional
- ✅ Enhanced plugin manager integration working
- ✅ Dark theme implementation complete
- ✅ Fallback systems operational

The Clean Plugin Runner is now fully integrated into the Aetherra Hybrid Window
and provides a comprehensive interface for plugin execution with direct
