## API Server Startup Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

### Problem Identified:
The Lyrixa launcher wasn't starting the API server due to **Unicode encoding errors** in Windows console output.

### Root Cause:
- `run_self_improvement_api.py` contained Unicode emoji characters (ðŸš€, âš¡, etc.)
- Windows `cp1252` encoding couldn't handle these characters
- Server process crashed immediately on startup with `UnicodeEncodeError`
- This caused the 60-second timeout in `wait_for_api_server()`

### Solution Applied:
1. **Fixed Unicode Issues:**
   - Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII equivalents
   - Changed `ðŸš€` â†’ "Starting", `âš¡` â†’ ">>", `â€¢` â†’ "-"
   - Updated both `run_self_improvement_api.py` and `launch_utils.py`

2. **Enhanced Debugging:**
   - Added process ID logging
   - Created `api_server_startup.log` for error tracking
   - Added working directory specification
   - Enhanced error reporting in launch_utils

### Files Modified:
- `run_self_improvement_api.py` - Removed Unicode characters
- `Aetherra/utils/launch_utils.py` - Enhanced debugging and removed Unicode

### Verification Results:
âœ… API server now starts successfully in ~2.4 seconds
âœ… Health endpoint responds: `{"status":"healthy","service":"Enhanced Lyrixa API (Fast Start)"}`
âœ… Launcher initialization completes successfully
âœ… GUI components load properly:
   - Plugin Editor tab added
   - Model dropdown populated
   - Background monitoring initialized

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test API server directly
python run_self_improvement_api.py

# Test health endpoint
curl http://127.0.0.1:8007/health

# Test launcher
python Aetherra/lyrixa/launcher.py
```

### Issue Status: RESOLVED âœ…
The API server now starts correctly when launching `Aetherra\lyrixa\launcher.py`
