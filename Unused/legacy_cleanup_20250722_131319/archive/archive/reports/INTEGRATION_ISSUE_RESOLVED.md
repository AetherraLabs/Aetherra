# 🎉 LYRIXA INTEGRATION ISSUE RESOLVED - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: `❌ Integration test failed: cannot import name 'ModernLyrixaGUI' from 'modern_lyrixa_gui'`

- ✅ All imports now working correctly

### 2. Enhanced Multi-Agent System (`lyrixa/core/multi_agent_system.py`)
- ✅ **LyrixaMultiAgentSystem** class - Complete orchestration system
- ✅ **AgentRole** enum - Agent role definitions
