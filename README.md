# � NeuroCode - The First AI-Native Programming Language

**NeuroCode** is not Python. **NeuroCode** is not JavaScript. **NeuroCode** is not any existing language.

**NeuroCode is the world's first AI-native programming language** — a revolutionary cognitive computing platform where code thinks, learns, and evolves alongside developers. Unlike traditional languages that execute instructions, NeuroCode expresses intentions, goals, and behaviors that are interpreted by an AI-powered runtime.

## 🌟 What Makes NeuroCode Revolutionary

### 🧠 **Cognitive Programming Paradigm**
Traditional languages tell computers **HOW** to do things. NeuroCode tells them **WHAT** you want to achieve.

```neurocode
# Traditional approach (Python/JavaScript):
def optimize_performance():
    metrics = collect_metrics()
    if metrics.error_rate > 0.05:
        analyze_and_fix()

# NeuroCode approach (AI-native):
goal: optimize system performance > 95%
when error_rate > 5%:
    suggest fix for "performance issues"
    apply fix if confidence > 85%
end
```

### 🎯 **Intent-Driven Syntax**
Express goals and intentions, not step-by-step implementations:

```neurocode
goal: reduce memory usage by 30% priority: critical
agent: on
optimize for "user_experience"
learn from "production_logs"
adapt to user_behavior_patterns
```

## 🌐 Current Features & Evolution

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Advanced Syntax & Program Control**
- **User-Defined Functions**: `define optimize_network() ... end`, `run optimize_network()`
- **Multi-line Block Parsing**: Support for structured code blocks with proper indentation
- **Loops & Conditionals**: `for item in list`, `while condition`, `if condition ... else ... end`
- **Simulation Mode**: `simulate agent for 24h` - test logic without applying changes
- **Variable Assignments**: `x = value`, reference variables in expressions
- **Complex Control Flow**: Nested blocks, function parameters, range iteration

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Self-Editing System**
- **File Analysis**: `load "filename.py"`, `analyze "filename.py"`
- **AI-Powered Refactoring**: `refactor "filename.py" "target"`
- **Safe Code Modification**: `diff fix_id`, `apply fix fix_id`
- **Memory-Driven Justification**: System explains changes using accumulated knowledge
- **Proactive Suggestions**: `self edit opportunities` based on memory patterns
- **Safety Controls**: `set self_edit_mode on/off`, automatic backups

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Automatic Debug & Self-Correction System**
- **Error Detection**: Automatic detection of syntax/runtime errors with memory storage
- **AI-Driven Fix Suggestions**: `suggest fix for "SyntaxError at line 22"` - AI analyzes and proposes solutions
- **Self-Repair**: `apply fix` - Automatic code correction with confidence/risk assessment  
- **Reflective Debug Loop**: `if error: suggest fix; apply fix if confidence > 80%`
- **Debug Commands**: `debug status`, `set auto_debug on 80`, `apply fix force`
- **Memory Integration**: Error patterns stored and recalled for learning
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups before applying fixes

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Self-Awareness & Goal-Driven Execution**
- **Intent & Goal System**: `goal: maintain performance > 90%`, `agent: on`
- **Pattern Recognition**: `if memory.pattern("crash", frequency="daily"): suggest fix`
- **Tagged Memory**: `remember("api limit hit") as "rate-limiting"`
- **Reflective Loop Engine**: Autonomous monitoring and improvement
- **Meta-Plugins**: `meta: memory_analyzer`, `meta: system_optimizer`

### 🔮 **FUTURE ROADMAP**
- Local model support (Mistral, LLaMA)
- Advanced pattern recognition and predictive analysis
- Multi-agent collaboration systems
- Terminal-based version (Textual)
- Integration with external development tools
- Real-time collaborative NeuroCode editing

## 🚀 What Is It?
Neuroplex is more than a language — it's an evolving environment where your code:
- Learns from usage logs and patterns
- Suggests improvements in real-time
- Remembers preferences and behaviors
- Embeds LLM-based reasoning directly into execution
- Can read, reflect on, and improve its own codebase

Think of it as coding with a **self-aware assistant** inside your language.

## 💡 Key Features

### 🔹 NeuroCode
An AI-augmented syntax that supports:
```neurocode
# User-defined functions with loops and conditionals
define optimize_network()
    learn from "usage.log"
    for component in ["cpu", "memory", "disk"]
        if memory.pattern(component + "_issue", frequency="daily")
            suggest fix for component + " performance"
        end
    end
    remember("Network optimization completed") as "maintenance"
end

# Execute functions and simulate behavior
run optimize_network()
simulate agent for 24h

# Advanced memory and pattern operations
remember("user prefers GPU") as "preferences"
if memory.pattern("crash", frequency="daily")
    goal: improve system stability priority: high
    agent: on
end

# Self-editing and analysis
load "core/interpreter.py"
analyze "core/interpreter.py"
refactor "core/interpreter.py" "performance"
apply fix fix_id

# Automatic Debug & Self-Correction System
debug status                                    # Show debug system status
set auto_debug on 80                           # Enable auto-debug with 80% confidence
load "buggy_file.py"                          # Auto-detects errors in loaded files
suggest fix for "SyntaxError at line 22"      # AI analyzes and suggests fix
apply fix                                      # Apply fix (if confidence > threshold)
apply fix force                                # Force apply regardless of risk

# Reflective debug loop for agent mode
if error:
    suggest fix
    apply fix if confidence > 80%
end
```
