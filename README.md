## 🚀 **What is Aetherra?**

**Aetherra** is a revolutionary AI-native development environment that transforms how you create, think, and build software. With **Lyrixa** as your intelligent companion, Aetherra bridges the gap between human creativity and artificial intelligence.

### **Core Philosophy**

> *"Code should think, learn, and evolve alongside you."*

Aetherra isn't just another IDE—it's an **AI-collaborative workspace** where:

- 🧠 Your code understands context and intent

- 🤖 AI assists in real-time without interruption

- 📈 Projects grow smarter with every interaction

- 🎯 Development becomes a conversation, not a struggle

### **First Look: Aetherra in Action**

**Traditional Programming (Python):**

```python
# Calculate Fibonacci sequence

def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)

result = calculate_fibonacci(10)
print(f"Fibonacci(10) = {result}")
```

**Aetherra Programming:**

```aetherra

goal: calculate fibonacci sequence

think "I need the 10th fibonacci number"
calculate fibonacci(10)
display result with style="elegant"
```

**That's it!** No boilerplate, no syntax complexity. Pure intent-driven programming that reads like natural language but executes intelligently.

## 🌌 **Introducing `.aether` Workflows**

`.aether` is Aetherra's revolutionary domain-specific language (DSL) designed for AI-native programming. It enables you to define workflows, goals, and actions in a human-readable format that Lyrixa can understand and execute.

### **Why `.aether`?**

- **Intent-Driven**: Focus on *what* you want to achieve, not *how* to do it.
- **AI-Enhanced**: Leverages Lyrixa's intelligence to execute workflows seamlessly.
- **Readable & Maintainable**: Designed to be as intuitive as natural language.


### **Example Workflow: Daily Log Summarizer**

```aether
plugin "daily_log_summarizer":
  description: "Summarizes daily system logs and stores the digest in memory"

  trigger:
    schedule: daily at "22:00"
    if memory.has("new_logs")

  memory:
    retrieve:
      from: "system.logs.daily"
      limit: 1d
    store:
      into: "summaries.logs.daily"

  ai:
    goal: "Summarize the key events from today’s logs"
    model: gpt-4o
    constraints:
      - no duplicate entries
      - include timestamps and severity levels
    output: summary_text

  actions:
    - memory.save("summaries.logs.daily", summary_text)
    - notify(user: "summary_ready", content: summary_text)

  feedback:
    expect: confirmation from user within 2h
    if no_response:
      escalate_to("admin_review_queue")
```


### **How to Use `.aether` Workflows**

1. **Create a Workflow**:

   - Write your `.aether` code in a file (e.g., `my_workflow.aether`).
   - Use the `.aether/examples/` directory for inspiration.

2. **Run the Workflow**:

   - Use the Aetherra launcher to execute your workflow:

     ```bash
     python launchers/main.py
     ```

   - Input your `.aether` code or load it from a file.

3. **Extend and Customize**:

   - Modify existing workflows or create new ones to suit your needs.
   - Leverage Lyrixa's memory, AI, and plugin systems for advanced functionality.
