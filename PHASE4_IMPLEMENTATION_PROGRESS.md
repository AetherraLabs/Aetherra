- Integration with Lyrixa's conversational interface

### 2. Plugin State Memory System
**File:** `lyrixa/core/plugin_state_memory.py`

**Features Implemented:**
- **PluginStateMemory**: Core persistent state management
  - Multi-type state storage (JSON, pickle, text)
  - Session-aware state tracking
  - Memory caching for performance
  - Cross-plugin shared state with permissions

- **CognitivePluginMemory**: Higher-level cognitive integration
  - Conversation history tracking
  - Success/failure pattern learning
  - Plugin performance insights
  - Optimization suggestions based on usage patterns

**Key Capabilities:**
- Plugins maintain state across sessions
- Learning from user interactions
- Shared state between plugins with access control
- Automatic cleanup of old data to prevent bloat

### 3. Enhanced Plugin Manager Integration
**File:** `lyrixa/core/plugins.py` (enhanced)

**Features Implemented:**
- Integrated semantic discovery into main plugin manager
- Added state memory management methods
- Enhanced plugin execution with performance tracking
- Added cognitive memory for interaction learning
- Plugin base class enhanced with state memory helpers

**Key Improvements:**
- Plugins now have easy access to persistent state via `self.set_state()`, `self.get_state()`
- Automatic tracking of plugin execution metrics
- Integration with Lyrixa's cognitive framework
- Memory cleanup and optimization tools

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- **goal_mappings**: User goal to plugin relevance mappings
- **plugin_states**: Persistent plugin state storage
- **plugin_contexts**: Conversation history and learning data
- **plugin_evolution**: Behavioral adaptation data
- **shared_states**: Cross-plugin state sharing with permissions

### Integration Points
- **LyrixaPluginManager**: Main orchestration layer
- **LyrixaPlugin**: Base class with state memory helpers

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### For Plugin Developers
```python
class MyPlugin(LyrixaPlugin):
    async def execute(self, command, params=None):
        # Access persistent state
        count = self.get_state("execution_count", 0)
        self.set_state("execution_count", count + 1)

        # Share data with other plugins
        self.set_shared_state("analysis", "results", data, ["OtherPlugin"])

        return {"result": "success"}
```

### For Lyrixa Users
```python
# Natural language plugin discovery
suggestions = await plugin_manager.suggest_plugins_for_goal("analyze my code for bugs")
# Returns: "I found 2 plugins that can help with 'analyze my code for bugs':
#          1. **CodeAnalyzerPlugin** - Analyzes code quality and identifies potential bugs..."

# Get plugin insights
insights = plugin_manager.get_plugin_insights("CodeAnalyzerPlugin")
# Returns performance data, success patterns, optimization suggestions
```
