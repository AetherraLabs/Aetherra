🧠 Intent Translation Complete!
Intent Type: api_creation
Confidence: 0.89

Generated Aetherra:
goal: create production_ready_api priority: high
agent: on

define create_user_management_api()
    remember("Creating user_management API") as "development"
    
    implement authentication
    enable encryption
    setup load_balancing
    
    when request_received:
        validate input_data
        process request
        return response
    end
end

run create_user_management_api()
```

### **Local AI Queries**
```
Aetherra> ai: What makes Aetherra revolutionary?

🤖 [Local AI] Aetherra represents a paradigm shift from traditional programming 
to cognitive computing. Unlike other languages that execute instructions, 
Aetherra expresses intentions and goals that are interpreted by AI-powered 
runtime systems. This enables developers to program at the level of human 
intent rather than machine logic.
