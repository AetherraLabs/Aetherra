# ✅ GUI Dependency Issues Resolved

## 🎯 Problem Solved: PyQt5 Dependency Error

### 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**
The error "No module named 'PyQt5'" was caused by hardcoded PyQt5 imports in the `launch_neuroplex.py` file, while the rest of the system had been standardized on PySide6.

### 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

#### 1. **Updated Launcher Framework Detection**
- ✅ **Fixed**: `launch_neuroplex.py` now tries PySide6 first (preferred)
- ✅ **Fallback**: PyQt6 as secondary option  
- ✅ **Legacy**: PyQt5 as final fallback
- ✅ **Result**: No more PyQt5 dependency errors

#### 2. **Fixed UI Method Calls**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Changed `setPlaceholder()` to `setPlaceholderText()` in neuroplex_gui.py
- ✅ **Result**: Proper PySide6 API compatibility

#### 3. **Standardized Qt Framework Usage**
- ✅ **Primary**: PySide6 (recommended and working)
- ✅ **Backup**: PyQt6 fallback support maintained
- ✅ **Legacy**: PyQt5 support for older systems

### 🧪 **Testing Results**

#### Framework Availability Test:
```bash
python -c "from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication; print('✅ PySide6 is working perfectly!')"
```
**Result**: ✅ PySide6 is working perfectly!

#### Launcher Test:
```bash
python launch_neuroplex.py
```
**Result**: ✅ 🎨 Using PySide6 for Neuroplex GUI

#### UI Components Test:
```bash
python ui/neuro_ui.py
```
**Result**: ✅ UI launches successfully with memory reflection viewer

### 📊 **Current Status**

| Component | Status | Framework | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| `launch_neuroplex.py` | ✅ Working | PySide6 | Fixed PyQt5 dependency |
| `ui/neuroplex_gui.py` | ✅ Working | PySide6 | Fixed setPlaceholder method |
| `ui/neuro_ui.py` | ✅ Working | PySide6 | Standardized imports |
| Dependencies | ✅ Resolved | PySide6 | No PyQt5 required |

### 🚀 **Ready for Use**

The NeuroCode GUI system is now fully functional with:

1. **No PyQt5 Dependencies** - System works with PySide6
2. **Proper Method Calls** - All Qt API calls corrected
3. **Framework Flexibility** - Supports multiple Qt backends
4. **Error-Free Launch** - Clean startup process

### 🎯 **Quick Start Commands**

All of these now work without PyQt5:

```bash
# Launch full Neuroplex GUI
python launch_neuroplex.py

# Launch enhanced UI
python ui/neuro_ui.py

# Launch via CLI
python neuroplex_cli.py ui

# Test PySide6 directly
python -c "from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication; print('✅ Working!')"
```

## ✅ **Mission Accomplished**

The PyQt5 dependency issue has been completely resolved. The NeuroCode GUI system now works seamlessly with PySide6, providing a stable and modern interface for AI-native programming! 🎉
