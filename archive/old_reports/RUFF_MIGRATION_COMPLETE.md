# Ruff Migration Complete

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Deprecated Ruff Settings**
- ❌ Removed: `ruff.args: ["--line-length=100"]`
- ❌ Removed: `ruff.lint.enable: true`
- ❌ Removed: `ruff.format.enable: true` 
- ✅ Added: `ruff.enable: true`

### 2. **Created Modern Configuration**
- ✅ Added `pyproject.toml` with proper Ruff configuration
- ✅ Line length set to 100 (matching your preference)
- ✅ Import sorting enabled
- ✅ Comprehensive linting rules configured
- ✅ Project-specific module detection

### 3. **Updated Python Formatter**
- ❌ Removed: Black as default formatter
- ✅ Changed: Ruff as default Python formatter
- ✅ Added: Auto-fix on save
- ✅ Added: Import organization on save

### 4. **Disabled Conflicting Linters**
- ✅ Disabled Pylint (Ruff replaces it)
- ✅ Kept Flake8 disabled (Ruff replaces it)

## Benefits of New Setup

1. **Faster**: Ruff is significantly faster than Black + Pylint + Flake8
2. **Unified**: One tool for linting, formatting, and import sorting
3. **Modern**: Uses the latest Ruff native extension
4. **Configured**: Proper project-specific settings in `pyproject.toml`

## What the Warning Meant

The warning appeared because:
- The old `ruff-lsp` language server was deprecated
- VS Code's Ruff extension now uses a native implementation
- Old settings like `ruff.args` are no longer supported
- New extension uses `pyproject.toml` for configuration instead

## Current Status

✅ **Migration Complete** - Your project now uses:
- Modern Ruff extension
- Proper configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- Unified linting and formatting
- No more deprecation warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Restart VS Code** to ensure new settings take effect
2. **Test formatting** on a Python file (Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. **Verify linting** works by opening a Python file with issues

The deprecation warning should no longer appear!
