# GUI interface
gui = MemoryVisualizerGUI(inspector)
gui.run()
```

### 4. üèñÔ∏è Plugin Sandbox Environment
**Location**: `developer_tools/plugins/sandbox.py`

**Key Features**:
- Complete isolation from live system
- Memory and agent system mocking
- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, time)
- Step-through debugging capabilities
- Plugin dependency management
- Comprehensive test reporting
- GUI and CLI interfaces

**Usage**:
```python
from developer_tools.plugins.sandbox import PluginSandbox, SandboxConfig

config = SandboxConfig()
config.max_execution_time = 30
sandbox = PluginSandbox(config)

# Test a plugin
sandbox.load_plugin("my_plugin.py")
result = sandbox.run_plugin("my_plugin.py", "main")

# Generate report
report = sandbox.generate_test_report()
```

## üîß Tool Integration & Compatibility

### Integration with Existing Systems
- ‚úÖ **SafeFileWriter Integration**: All tools work seamlessly with existing `safe_file_operations.py`
- ‚úÖ **Lyrixa Backup System**: Compatible with `lyrixa_backup_system.py`
