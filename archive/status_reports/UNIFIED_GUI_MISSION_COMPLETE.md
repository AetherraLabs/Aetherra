  - ✅ Component registration and automatic binding
  - ✅ Real-time cross-phase data flow

- **Communication Matrix IMPLEMENTED:**
  ```
  Phase 1 Memory → Phase 4 Intelligence: semantic_events, context_clusters
  Phase 2 Anticipation → Phase 3 Notifications: pending_suggestions, confidence_score
  Phase 3 Performance Monitor → Phase 4 Analytics: resource_trends, agent_cpu_costs
  Phase 4 Feedback → Phase 2+1 Systems: user_preference_delta, suggestion_ratings
  ```

### ✅ 5. Real-Time Integration
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Live Updates Implemented:**
  - ✅ QTimer-based polling every 2 seconds
  - ✅ Memory graph live updates from Advanced Memory System
  - ✅ Analytics widget `refresh_data()` integration
  - ✅ Suggestion queue + confidence score real-time updates
  - ✅ Live feedback sync to memory + config modules

## 🚀 Usage

### Launch Unified GUI
```python
from lyrixa.gui.unified.main import UnifiedLyrixaLauncher
import asyncio

async def main():
    launcher = UnifiedLyrixaLauncher()
    await launcher.async_initialize()

    if launcher.main_window:
        launcher.main_window.show()
        # Qt event loop will handle GUI
    else:
        # Headless mode active
        print("Running in headless mode")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Direct Enhanced Window
```python
from lyrixa.gui import EnhancedLyrixaWindow
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication

app = QApplication([])
window = EnhancedLyrixaWindow()
window.show()
app.exec()
```
