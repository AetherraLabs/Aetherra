# NeuroHub Directory Cleanup Summary

## Files Analyzed

### README Files
- **README.md**: 429 lines - Comprehensive, up-to-date documentation (CANONICAL VERSION)
- **README-new.md**: 429 lines - Identical duplicate of README.md (REMOVED)
- **README-old.md**: 238 lines - Older, simpler version (ARCHIVED)

### Package.json Files
- **package.json**: 50 lines - Current active version (CANONICAL VERSION)
- **package-new.json**: 50 lines - Identical duplicate of package.json (REMOVED)
- **package-old.json**: 57 lines - Older version with different dependencies (ARCHIVED)

## Actions Taken

1. **Identified Active Files**: `README.md` and `package.json` are the canonical versions being used by the startup scripts
2. **Removed Duplicates**: Deleted `README-new.md` and `package-new.json` as they were identical to the canonical versions
3. **Archived Old Versions**: Moved `README-old.md` and `package-old.json` to `archive/historical/` for reference

## Current NeuroHub Structure

The neurohub directory now has a clean structure with:
- `README.md` - The single, canonical documentation
- `package.json` - The single, canonical package configuration
- Startup scripts that reference the correct files
- All other core files (server.js, HTML, JS files)

## Verification

✅ **README.md**: Contains comprehensive documentation matching the actual project structure  
✅ **package.json**: Contains current dependencies and scripts  
✅ **Startup Scripts**: Reference the correct files  
✅ **No Duplicates**: All redundant files removed  
✅ **Archives**: Old versions preserved in archive/historical/

The neurohub directory is now clean and organized with a single canonical README and package.json file.
