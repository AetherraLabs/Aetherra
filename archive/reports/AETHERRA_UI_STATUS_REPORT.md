- [x] Standardized spacing and professional appearance
- [x] Applied consistent code formatting and structure

### 2. Robust Fallback System

- [x] Created comprehensive Qt fallback module (`qt_fallbacks.py`)
- [x] Implemented safe UI call utilities (`safe_ui_calls.py`)
- [x] Built minimal fallback UI for non-GUI environments (`fallback_ui.py`)
- [x] Refactored main UI package (`__init__.py`) with layered fallbacks

### 3. Error Handling & Testing

- [x] Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout UI system
- [x] Created robust main window implementation (`lyrixa_fixed.py`)
- [x] Built comprehensive test suite (`test_ui_comprehensive.py`)
- [x] Fixed syntax errors in original files
- [x] Verified Qt availability checks and import safety

### 4. Integration & Compatibility

- [x] Ensured BasicAetherraUI class availability and proper inheritance
- [x] Maintained backwards compatibility with existing code
- [x] Tested fallback behavior when Qt is unavailable
- [x] Verified main GUI launch functionality
