## 🎯 Key Integration Features

### Cross-System Intelligence
- **Stability + Introspection**: Errors are logged and reflected upon for continuous improvement
- **Persona + Plugin Suggestions**: AI personality influences plugin recommendations
- **Memory + Conversation**: Full memory context drives more intelligent responses
- **Performance + Degradation**: Real-time performance monitoring triggers graceful feature degradation

### Unified Error Handling
- All systems use the same stability framework for consistent error recovery
- Circuit breakers protect individual components from cascade failures
- Graceful degradation ensures the system remains functional even during issues

### Self-Awareness Infrastructure
- Every operation is logged and reflected upon
- AI learns from its own behavior patterns
- Continuous optimization based on execution history
- Real-time activity dashboard shows AI "thinking" process
