üß¨ Aetherra Language Achievement Summary
=======================================

‚úÖ FORMAL GRAMMAR: Lark parser with EBNF rules in core/Aetherra_grammar.py
‚úÖ SYNTAX-NATIVE: .neuro files parsed directly, no longer Python-wrapped  
‚úÖ AST GENERATION: Complete Abstract Syntax Tree construction
‚úÖ LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS: Goals, agents, memory, intent actions, variables, comments
‚úÖ FILE EXTENSION: .neuro files recognized as Aetherra programs
‚úÖ PARSER TESTING: Working validation system with examples/test.neuro

üéâ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Aetherra is now a true programming language!

TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE:
- BEFORE: Python framework simulating language constructs
- AFTER: True programming language with formal grammar and parser

Aetherra has successfully claimed its language identity and is now syntax-native!
