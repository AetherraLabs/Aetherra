üß¨ NeuroCode Language Achievement Summary
=======================================

‚úÖ FORMAL GRAMMAR: Lark parser with EBNF rules in core/neurocode_grammar.py
‚úÖ SYNTAX-NATIVE: .neuro files parsed directly, no longer Python-wrapped  
‚úÖ AST GENERATION: Complete Abstract Syntax Tree construction
‚úÖ LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS: Goals, agents, memory, intent actions, variables, comments
‚úÖ FILE EXTENSION: .neuro files recognized as NeuroCode programs
‚úÖ PARSER TESTING: Working validation system with examples/test.neuro

üéâ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: NeuroCode is now a true programming language!

TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE:
- BEFORE: Python framework simulating language constructs
- AFTER: True programming language with formal grammar and parser

NeuroCode has successfully claimed its language identity and is now syntax-native!

üöÄ STANDARD LIBRARY COMPLETE:
‚úÖ 7 CORE PLUGINS IMPLEMENTED AND FUNCTIONAL:
   1. sysmon - System performance monitoring
   2. optimizer - Performance optimization engine  
   3. coretools - File & data management (30+ actions)
   4. executor - Command scheduling & execution
   5. reflector - Behavior analysis & self-reflection
   6. selfrepair - Automated debug & repair
   7. whisper - Audio transcription & speech processing

‚úÖ PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE: Standardized interface with execute_action()
‚úÖ LIBRARY MANAGER: Automatic plugin discovery and loading
‚úÖ INTEGRATION TESTING: All plugins tested and verified functional
‚úÖ REAL-WORLD READY: Practical capabilities for system admin, data processing, automation

üìä FINAL STATUS: NeuroCode is now a complete programming language with a rich standard library!

The language foundation is established. NeuroCode can now handle real-world programming tasks.
