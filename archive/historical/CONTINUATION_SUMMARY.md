## üöÄ Current Capabilities

NeuroCode is now fully capable of:

### **1. Multi-Model AI Programming**
```neurocode
# Privacy-first local analysis
model: "mistral"
assistant: "analyze this sensitive user data"

# Switch to cloud for complex reasoning
model: "gpt-4"
assistant: "develop optimization strategy"

# Use specialized model for implementation
model: "codellama"
assistant: "generate the optimized code"
```

### **2. Intelligent Code Development**
```neurocode
# AI-powered code review
define review_code(filename)
    load filename
    model: "gpt-4"
    technical_analysis = assistant: "analyze code quality and patterns"
    
    model: "claude-3"
    security_review = assistant: "identify security vulnerabilities"
    
    return combine_insights(technical_analysis, security_review)
end
```

### **3. Adaptive Programming**
```neurocode
# Self-improving systems
goal: "optimize system performance" priority: high
when performance < 90%:
    analyze_bottlenecks()
    suggest_improvements()
    apply_if_confidence > 80%
end
```
