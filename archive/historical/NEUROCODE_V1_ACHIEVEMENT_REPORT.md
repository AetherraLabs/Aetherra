## üî• Key Technical Innovations

### **1. Multi-LLM Syntax**
```neurocode
# Privacy-first workflow
model: "mistral"                    # Local analysis
assistant: "analyze user data locally"

model: "gpt-4"                      # Cloud reasoning  
assistant: "develop optimization strategy"

model: "codellama"                  # Specialized generation
assistant: "implement the solution"
```

### **2. AI-Native Control Flow**
```neurocode
# Conditional AI model selection
if privacy_required:
    model: "mistral"     # Keep data local
else:
    model: "gpt-4"       # Best performance
end

assistant: "process request according to privacy settings"
```

### **3. Cross-Model Validation**
```neurocode
# Get multiple AI perspectives
define get_consensus(problem)
    insights = []
    
    for model_name in ["gpt-4", "claude-3", "mistral"]:
        model: model_name
        insight = assistant: "analyze " + problem
        insights.append(insight)
    end
    
    return synthesize_insights(insights)
end
```
