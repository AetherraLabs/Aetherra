- `format_startup_message()` - User-friendly startup summary

**System Monitoring:**
- `_check_memory_system()` - Memory DB and connection health
- `_check_plugin_manager()` - Plugin loading and activation status
- `_check_goal_system()` - Goal tracking and progress monitoring
- `_check_feedback_system()` - Feedback collection and learning metrics
- `_check_database_connections()` - All database connectivity
- `_check_file_system()` - Workspace permissions and disk space
- `_check_system_resources()` - CPU, memory, and performance

### 🔧 Integration Points

#### **In LyrixaAI Assistant (`lyrixa/assistant.py`):**
```python
# System Bootstrap Integration
self.system_bootstrap = LyrixaSystemBootstrap(
    workspace_path=self.workspace_path,
    memory_system=self.memory,
    plugin_manager=self.plugins,
    goal_system=self.goals,
    feedback_system=self.feedback_system
)

# Startup Summary Method
async def display_startup_summary(self):
    startup_summary = await self.system_bootstrap.perform_system_bootstrap()
    startup_message = self.system_bootstrap.format_startup_message(startup_summary)
    print("\n" + startup_message)
    return startup_summary
```

### 📊 Startup Summary Examples

#### **First Launch:**
```
👋 Hello! I'm Lyrixa, your AI assistant. Let's get started!

💡 Suggestions:
   • Set some development goals
   • Explore what I can help you with
   • Start a new project or conversation

What would you like to work on today?
```

#### **Daily Return:**
```
🌅 Good to see you again! Ready to continue where we left off?

📋 System Status:
   🟢 All systems running optimally

⏰ Last session: 1 day(s) ago

🧠 Memory & Context:
   I remember 245 interactions and can recall our conversation history.

🎯 Active Goals:
   • 3 active development goals

🧩 Available Tools: 8 plugins loaded

📈 Recent Activity:
   • Code review completed
   • Documentation updated
   • Performance optimization

### 🌡️ Health Monitoring

#### **System Health Report Example:**
```
🔍 LYRIXA SYSTEM HEALTH REPORT
Generated: 2025-07-06 14:30:22

🌡️ Overall Health: 85.7%

📊 Component Status:
   🟢 Memory System: active (Health: 90.0%)
   🟡 Plugin Manager: inactive (Health: 60.0%)
   🟢 Goal System: active (Health: 85.0%)
   🟢 Feedback System: active (Health: 95.0%)
   🟢 Database Connections: active (Health: 100.0%)
   🟢 File System: active (Health: 88.0%)
   🟢 System Resources: active (Health: 92.0%)

💡 Recommendations:
   • No plugins loaded - consider loading useful plugins
   • 2 goals are overdue
```

### 🔄 Session Continuity

The system maintains session history in `lyrixa_session_history.json`:
- Tracks previous session timestamps
- Remembers component health states
- Preserves context for intelligent startup messages
- Enables "where we left off" awareness

### 🎮 Usage

#### **Programmatic Access:**
```python
# Get current system status
status = await lyrixa.system_bootstrap.get_current_system_status()
print(f"Overall Health: {status['overall_health']:.1%}")

# Generate detailed health report
health_report = await lyrixa.system_bootstrap.generate_health_report()
print(health_report)

# Display startup summary
await lyrixa.display_startup_summary()
```

#### **Automatic Integration:**
The system bootstrap runs automatically when Lyrixa initializes, providing immediate system awareness and context-appropriate startup messages.

### ✅ Success Criteria Met

1. **✅ Plugins loaded detection** - Plugin manager status and loaded plugin enumeration
2. **✅ Memory DB connected** - Database connectivity and health monitoring
3. **✅ Goals in progress** - Active goal tracking and progress reporting
4. **✅ Startup summary** - "Here's what I remember and where we left off" messaging
5. **✅ System awareness** - Comprehensive component health monitoring
6. **✅ Context recognition** - Intelligent startup context determination
7. **✅ Continuation suggestions** - Smart recommendations based on system state

### 🚀 Production Ready

The System Bootstrap + Awareness feature is **fully implemented, tested, and production-ready**. It provides Lyrixa with complete self-awareness of her system state and enables intelligent, contextual startup interactions that help users understand system status and continue their work effectively.

The system automatically:
- Monitors all critical components
- Detects system health issues
- Provides helpful recommendations
- Maintains session continuity
- Offers contextual startup experiences
- Enables "where we left off" awareness

**Lyrixa is now fully aware of her own capabilities and can intelligently communicate her system status to users!** 🎉
