## 🚀 USAGE

### Basic Usage

```python
from lyrixa.assistant import LyrixaAI

# Initialize with reflexive loop
lyrixa = LyrixaAI(workspace_path="./project")
await lyrixa.initialize()

# Process interaction (automatically includes self-awareness)
response = await lyrixa.brain_loop(
    "I'm building an AI system using Python and need help with async patterns",
    input_type="text"
)

# Lyrixa will automatically:
# - Update project understanding
# - Analyze user patterns
# - Generate contextual insights
# - Enhance responses with self-awareness
```

### Advanced Features

```python
# Get current self-awareness state
insights = await lyrixa.get_self_awareness_insights()
print(f"Project: {insights['project_understanding']['project_name']}")
print(f"Patterns: {len(insights['user_patterns'])}")

# Update Lyrixa's self-knowledge
await lyrixa.update_lyrixa_self_knowledge(
    "This project focuses on enterprise AI with microservices architecture"
)

# Generate project insights
project_insights = await lyrixa.generate_project_insights()
for insight in project_insights:
    print(f"💡 {insight}")
```
