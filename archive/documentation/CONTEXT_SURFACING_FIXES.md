# 🔧 CONTEXT-AWARE SURFACING FIXES - COMPLETE

## ✅ All Errors Fixed Successfully

**Date:** July 7, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE - All errors resolved and functionality verified

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Type Annotation Issues
**Problem:** Parameters with default `None` values were not properly typed as `Optional`

**Files Fixed:**
- `lyrixa/plugins/context_aware_surfacing.py`

**Specific Fixes:**
- ✅ `get_context_recommendations()` method: `context: ContextSnapshot = None` → `context: Optional[ContextSnapshot] = None`
- ✅ `record_plugin_usage()` method: `execution_time: float = None` → `execution_time: Optional[float] = None`
- ✅ `get_recommendations()` function: `context: ContextSnapshot = None` → `context: Optional[ContextSnapshot] = None`

### 2. Unused Import Cleanup
**Problem:** Several imports were not being used in the code

**Fixes:**
- ✅ Removed unused `import time`
- ✅ Removed unused `typing.Any` import
- ✅ Kept `typing.Optional` as it's now being used properly
