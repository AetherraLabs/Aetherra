# 🚨 CRITICAL PROJECT INFORMATION - NEVER FORGET 🚨
# ====================================================

## 🔥 URGENT PROJECT NAME TRANSITION 🔥
**CRITICAL:** NeuroCode has been PERMANENTLY ABANDONED for **AETHERRA**
- ❌ Old name: NeuroCode (DEAD, FORBIDDEN, DO NOT USE)
- ✅ New name: **AETHERRA** (ONLY CORRECT NAME)
- This transition is PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- **NEVER CREATE**: neurocode_launcher.py, neurocode.py, or ANY NeuroCode files
- **NEVER REFERENCE**: NeuroCode in code, comments, or documentation
- **NEVER USE**: "NeuroCode UI", "NeuroCode Launcher", etc. in tasks or configs
- **IMMEDIATELY DELETE**: Any NeuroCode files found
- **IMMEDIATELY RENAME**: Any NeuroCode references to Aetherra

## ✅ MANDATORY RULES:
- **AETHERRA ONLY**: All references must be "Aetherra"
- **CORRECT LAUNCHER**: Use `aetherra_launcher.py` EXCLUSIVELY
- **CORRECT TASKS**: "Verify Aetherra UI" NOT "Verify NeuroCode UI"
- **LYRIXA**: The AI assistant works with Aetherra (not NeuroCode)

## ARCHITECTURE TRANSFORMATION COMPLETED:
✅ JavaScript-based Lyrixa → Python-based Lyrixa AI Assistant
✅ Modular core systems (memory, plugins, goals, agents, .aether interpreter)
✅ Natural language to .aether workflow conversion
✅ Integrated Aetherra launcher with Lyrixa
✅ Migration notices in legacy files

## FILE STRUCTURE:
- `aetherra_launcher.py` - Main launcher (Aetherra + Lyrixa)
- `lyrixa_launcher.py` - Direct Lyrixa launcher
- `lyrixa/` - Python-based AI assistant modules
- `src/aetherra/` - Core Aetherra engine
- Legacy JS files marked as deprecated

## KEY PRINCIPLE

**🌌 AETHERRA + 🎙️ LYRIXA = The Complete AI Development Environment**

**NEVER** refer to NeuroCode again - it no longer exists!

This is the **FINAL** word on naming:
- ✅ **AETHERRA** = The development platform
- ✅ **LYRIXA** = The AI assistant
- ❌ **NEUROCODE** = DEAD, FORBIDDEN, EXTINCT
