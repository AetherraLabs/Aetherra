## 🚀 LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS:

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Main launcher (recommended)
python lyrixa_launcher.py

# Direct module launch
python -c "import asyncio; from lyrixa import LyrixaAI; asyncio.run(LyrixaAI().process_natural_language('Hello!'))"

# Test basic functionality
python lyrixa/tests/basic_functionality_test.py
```

### Integration with Aetherra:
```bash
# Launch integrated system
python aetherra_launcher.py
```
