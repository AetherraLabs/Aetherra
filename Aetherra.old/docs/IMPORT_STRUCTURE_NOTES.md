# Import Structure Refactoring

## Changes Made

### 1. Organized Qt Imports

- Grouped imports by Qt module:
  - `QtCore` imports
  - `QtGui` imports
  - `QtWidgets` imports

- Removed unused imports
  - Removed imports that weren't actually used in files
  - Fixed lint errors related to unused imports

### 2. Improved Module Path Setup

- Standardized path setup at the top of files
- Used absolute imports where appropriate
- Maintained backward compatibility with relative imports as fallbacks

### 3. Improved Dummy Classes for Fallbacks

- Enhanced dummy class implementation with proper docstrings
- Made fallback objects more compatible with their real counterparts
- Added clear console warnings when fallback is used

## Remaining Issues

1. **Type Checking Errors**:
   - There are still some type checking errors related to importing classes that are later shadowed by local classes with the same name
   - Need to review how dummy classes are implemented to avoid namespace conflicts

2. **Import Style Consistency**:
   - Different files use different import styles (absolute vs relative)
   - Need to standardize on a single approach

3. **Circular Imports**:
   - Some files may have circular import dependencies
   - Should review the module structure to eliminate circular dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Import Refactoring**:
   - Fix remaining type errors by properly scoping dummy classes
   - Standardize on a consistent import style (preferably absolute)

2. **Improve Dummy Class Completeness**:
   - Enhance dummy class implementations to match the real API
   - Add proper typing annotations to dummy classes
   - Ensure graceful fallbacks for all essential functionality

3. **Module Structure**:
   - Review overall module structure
   - Consider reorganizing to avoid circular dependencies
   - Document import patterns for maintainers
