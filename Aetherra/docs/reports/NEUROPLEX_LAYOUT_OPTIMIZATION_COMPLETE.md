# 🧬 Neuroplex GUI v2.0 Layout Optimization Complete

## Summary
Successfully resolved text cutoff issues and button fitting problems in the Neuroplex GUI v2.0 through comprehensive layout optimization.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Cutoff Issues ✅
**Problem**: Text in cards and panels was being cut off due to excessive margins and padding.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Reduced card margins from 16px to 8px (horizontal) and 12px to 6px (vertical)
- ✅ Reduced card spacing from 10px to 6px
- ✅ Limited title label height to 30px maximum
- ✅ Optimized font sizes (heading: 16px → 14px)
- ✅ Reduced padding in card styles from 12px to 6px

### 2. Button Fitting Problems ✅
**Problem**: Buttons were too wide and didn't fit properly in narrow panels.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Shortened button text and used icons where possible
- ✅ Set maximum button widths (35px for icon buttons, 60px for text buttons)
- ✅ Added tooltips to provide full functionality descriptions
- ✅ Reduced button heights (28px → 24px) and padding

### 3. Panel Sizing Optimization ✅
**Problem**: Panels were too wide and caused horizontal scrolling issues.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Reduced left panel: 320-380px → 260-320px
- ✅ Reduced right panel: 350-450px → 260-320px  
- ✅ Optimized center panel minimum width: 600px → 500px
- ✅ Better splitter proportions: [320,800,350] → [280,700,280]

### 4. Main Window Sizing ✅
**Problem**: Minimum window size was too large for smaller screens.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Reduced minimum size: 1800x1200 → 1600x1000
- ✅ Set better default size: 1800x1100
- ✅ Improved responsiveness for different screen sizes
