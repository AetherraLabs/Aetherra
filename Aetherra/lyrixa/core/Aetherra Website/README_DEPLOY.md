# Push to main branch (triggers deployment)
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: GitHub Pages Configuration

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/Zyonic88/Aetherra/settings`
   - Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar

2. **Configure Pages Source**
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - Branch: Not applicable (using Actions workflow)

3. **Verify Workflow Permissions**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/Zyonic88/Aetherra/settings/actions`
   - Ensure "Read and write permissions" are enabled
   - Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check Actions Workflow**
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/Zyonic88/Aetherra/actions`
   - Monitor "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Ensure both "build" and "deploy" jobs complete successfully

2. **Verify Build Output**
   - Build should complete without errors
   - Dist folder should be generated and uploaded
   - All assets should be properly bundled

### Step 5: Access Live Website

Once deployment completes (typically 2-5 minutes):

**üåê Live URL: `https://zyonic88.github.io/Aetherra/`**
