- **Autonomous System Management**: Self-optimizing performance
- **Universal AI Translation**: Communicate with any AI system

## Quick Start Guide

### Your First Aetherra Program

```aether
// Welcome to the neural future!
lyrixa.log("Hello, AI-Native World!");

// Create your first neural network
const network = new NeuralNetwork();
network.addLayer(64, "relu");
network.addLayer(10, "softmax");

lyrixa.log("Neural network ready for training!");
```

### Basic Memory Management

```aether
// Allocate memory for AI workloads
const aiMemory = lyrixa.allocateMemory(1024 * 1024); // 1MB
lyrixa.log("AI memory allocated: " + aiMemory.size + " bytes");

// Create persistent storage for models
const modelStorage = lyrixa.createPersistentMemory("my_models", 10 * 1024 * 1024);
modelStorage.store("classifier_v1", neuralNetworkWeights);

// Cleanup when done
aiMemory.deallocate();
```

### Loading AI Plugins

```aether
// Extend your capabilities with AI plugins
const optimizer = lyrixa.loadPlugin("neural_optimizer");
const visualizer = lyrixa.loadPlugin("ai_visualizer");

// Use plugin functionality
optimizer.optimizePerformance();
visualizer.renderNeuralNetwork(network);

lyrixa.log("AI plugins loaded and ready!");
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Neural-First Design
Aetherra treats AI as a first-class citizen. Every operation is optimized for neural processing, from memory allocation to task scheduling.

### 2. Quantum Integration
Quantum computing isn't separate‚Äîit's integrated into the core OS, allowing seamless hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

### 3. Adaptive Memory
The memory system learns and adapts to your AI workloads, automatically optimizing allocation patterns and data placement.

### 4. Plugin Ecosystem
Extend Aetherra with neural-powered plugins that can learn, adapt, and collaborate with each other.
